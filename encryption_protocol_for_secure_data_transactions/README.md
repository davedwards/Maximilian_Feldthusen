Encryption protocol using C++ to secure data transactions:

Below is an example implementation of an advanced code encryption protocol using C++ to secure data transactions:

In this implementation, the encryptData function performs XOR encryption on the input data using a given key. The decryptData function decrypts the encrypted data using the same key. The main function demonstrates how to encrypt and decrypt a test message using the provided encryption protocol.

Please note that this is a simple example and there are many more complex encryption algorithms and techniques that can be used to enhance security for data transactions. It is important to carefully assess your specific security requirements and choose the appropriate encryption protocol for your application.

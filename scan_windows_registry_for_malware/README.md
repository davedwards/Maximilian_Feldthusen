C++ code that scan windows registry for malware and other changes


Scanning the Windows registry for malware and changes can be a complex task that requires a good understanding of how the registry works and knowledge of malware behavior. Below is an example of C++ code that scans the Windows registry for specific changes and suspicious entries.
This code uses the Windows API functions to open the SOFTWARE registry key and recursively scan all its subkeys. The ScanRegistry function iterates through each subkey and recursively scans its subkeys. This can help in detecting any suspicious entries or changes.

#cpp #registry #windows #scan

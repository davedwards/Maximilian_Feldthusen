C++ 23 Concurrency and Security Features!

ðŸ’¡ We will focus on the std::jthread class, which makes thread management easier by automatically joining threads when they are destroyed. Furthermore, we will put in place security measures to make sure our concurrent code is resilient against possible vulnerabilities. To improve the reliability of our implementation, we will also incorporate error handling and exception handling.

Explanation

ðŸ‘‰ In the code below we define a SecureCounter class that manages a counter with thread-safe increment operations. The increment method utilizes a std::lock_guard to ensure that only one thread can modify the counter at any given time, which helps prevent data races. Additionally, we establish a maximum limit for the counter to illustrate error handling through an std::overflow_error exception.

ðŸ‘‰ The threadFunction is intended to increment the counter a specified number of times, and it handles any overflow errors that may occur. In the main function, we create multiple threads using std::jthread, which automatically joins when it goes out of scope, making thread management easier.

ðŸ¥· This code not only highlights the new concurrency features of C++ 23 but also underscores the significance of security and error handling in concurrent programming.
